 *  how to prevent Dev from committing secrets and credentials into git repositories by Abhinav Sejpal

Abstract: Sensitive information such as the AWS keys, access tokens, SSH keys etc. are often erroneously leaked via the public source code repositories due to accidental git commits. This can be avoided by using pre-commit hooks like “Talisman” which checks for sensitive information in the files before commits or push activity.
